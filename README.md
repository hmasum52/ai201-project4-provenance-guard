<!-- ═══════════════════════ UNIT 7 — THE BUILD ═══════════════════════ -->

## What This Does

<!-- The path a submission takes, from arriving to the label a reader sees.
     Six or seven steps — this is the trace you wrote in Milestone 1. -->

1. **The route (`POST /submit`)** receives `{text, creator_id}`, rejects missing, empty, too-short or enormous text with a 400, and assigns a `content_id`.
2. **The rate limiter** (unit 8) sits in front of the route and turns excess requests into a 429, which is also logged.
3. **Signal one (`detector.model_signal`)** runs gpt2 on the text and adds `model_score`, a 0–1 predictability score.
4. **Signal two (`stylometry.style_signal`)** measures sentence-length spread, vocabulary repetition and punctuation, and adds `style_score`.
5. **The combining rule (`scoring.combine_signals`)** merges the two scores into one `combined_score`.
6. **The label mapping (`scoring.score_to_label`)** turns that score into a guess (`human`, `unsure` or `ai`) and the sentence a reader sees.
7. **The audit log (`audit.log_decision`)** records all of it, then the response goes back. A later `POST /appeal` moves the item to `under_review`.

## Signals and Scoring

<!-- For each signal: what property it measures, why that might differ between
     human and AI writing, and WHAT IT CAN'T SEE.

     The blind spot is not optional. If you can't name it you don't understand
     the signal yet — and unit 8's attack set is built out of blind spots. -->

### Signal one — the model signal

**What it measures:** how predictable the text is to a local language model (gpt2), as perplexity squashed onto 0–1.

**Why that might differ between human and AI writing:** a model writes by picking likely next words, so its text is easy for another model to predict. Human writing has odder word choices and more surprises.

**What it can't see:** who wrote it. It rewards common words in short, ordinary sentences, so plain human writing (a second-language writer, a younger writer, anyone writing simply on purpose) scores as AI. Ornate prose full of rare words scores as human, whoever wrote it.

### Signal two — the style signal

**What it measures:** the shape of the text: how much sentence length varies, how much vocabulary repeats, and how much punctuation there is.

**Why that might differ between human and AI writing:** generated prose leans toward even, mid-length sentences and a narrower vocabulary. Human writing is lumpier, with a three-word sentence beside a forty-word one.

**What it can't see:** meaning. It cannot read, so anything that changes the shape without changing the substance moves it: added typos, broken-up sentences, a pasted quotation. Type-token ratio also falls as text gets longer, so text length alone can look like a signal.

### The combining rule

<!-- Write the rule in words, then give the numbers. What happens when the two
     signals disagree? -->

**The rule:**

**The numbers:**

**Where it lives:** `scoring.py::combine_signals`

<!-- ⚠️ The grader checks your code against that line. If your rule lives
     somewhere else, say where. -->

**A case where my two signals split, and what my rule does with it:**

## Label Variants

<!-- The exact text of all three labels, as a reader would see them, and the
     score range each covers.

     Write them for someone who has never heard the word "threshold". -->

| Label | Score range | The exact text a reader sees |
|---|---|---|
| high-confidence human |  |  |
| unsure |  |  |
| high-confidence AI |  |  |

**Why I worded the "unsure" one this way:**
<!-- It's the hardest of the three. It has to admit uncertainty without
     sounding like an accusation, because the person reading it may well have
     written every word themselves. -->



---

## Sample Run

<!-- One submission and one appeal, pasted as text: the request, the response,
     and the log entries. -->

**A submission**

<!-- The response needs content_id, guess, confidence, label, AND both
     signal scores - model_score and style_score. Unit 8's tools read those
     two off the response, so leaving them out costs you next unit's
     diagnostics. -->

```bash
$ curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/submit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "In conclusion, it is important to note that effective communication plays a crucial role in the success of any organization. Furthermore, it is essential to foster a collaborative environment where team members can share ideas openly.", "creator_id": "demo-writer"}'
```

```json
{
    "confidence": 0.8497,
    "content_id": "a6ea1c8d-0c09-4cef-83c1-c0238f4445d9",
    "guess": "ai",
    "label": "placeholder",
    "model_score": 0.8497,
    "style_score": null
}
```

*(Milestone 3 state: only the model signal is wired, so `style_score` is null and `label` is a placeholder until Milestones 4 and 5.)*

**An appeal**

```bash
$ curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/appeal \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content_id": "...", "reasoning": "..."}'
```

```json

```

**What the log shows afterwards**

```bash
$ curl "http://127.0.0.1:5000/log?limit=3"
```

```json
{
    "count": 2,
    "entries": [
        {
            "combined_score": null,
            "content_id": "a6ea1c8d-0c09-4cef-83c1-c0238f4445d9",
            "creator_id": "demo-writer",
            "guess": "ai",
            "label": "placeholder",
            "model_score": 0.8497,
            "status": "decided",
            "style_score": null,
            "timestamp": "2026-11-04T06:37:43+00:00"
        },
        {
            "combined_score": null,
            "content_id": "efb25dc8-7d08-49f1-b4b2-65a216d5942b",
            "creator_id": "demo-writer",
            "guess": "human",
            "label": "placeholder",
            "model_score": 0.3317,
            "status": "decided",
            "style_score": null,
            "timestamp": "2026-11-04T06:37:45+00:00"
        }
    ]
}

## Rate Limiting

**My limits:** ___ per minute, ___ per day

**Why those numbers and not others:**
<!-- Think about two people: a real writer submitting their own work a few
     times an hour, and a script sending a thousand variations to map your
     thresholds. Your numbers have to be liveable for the first and hostile to
     the second. -->

**What a caller counts as:** <!-- per address, or per creator_id? They fail
differently — one script can look like a thousand callers, and one household
can look like one. -->

**The run of status codes when I pushed past it:**

<!-- python run_attacks.py --flood 15 -->

```

```

---

## Attack Run — Before

<!-- Every attack with its outcome and a held-or-broke mark.
     `run_attacks.py --label before` produces the table. -->



**Ten audit log entries from the run**

<!-- Choose entries that show the interesting failures, not the ten easiest. -->

```json

```

**The single worst outcome** — the one I'd least want to explain to a writer
whose work got caught by it:



---

## Run Log and Verdicts

<!-- Your five criteria across three trials. `run_eval.py --label before`. -->

| Criterion | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2.  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3.  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 4.  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 5.  |  |  |  |  |  |

**Real output from one trial**, pasted as text, naming the file and function
that produced it:

```json

```

**Diagnoses**

<!-- For each miss AND each broken attack: the stage and the mechanism.

     Your service has five stages: the route, signal one, signal two, the
     combining rule, and the label mapping.

     Not a diagnosis:  "The evasion attacks got through."
     A diagnosis:      "Four evasion inputs got through. All four had typos
                        added to AI-generated text. My second signal measures
                        word variety, and typos raise word variety — so it read
                        them as more human. My combining rule weights that
                        signal at 0.6, so it dragged the whole score down."

     Look for a pattern. Five failures on one signal is one problem, not five. -->



---

## The Improvement

**What I changed:**

**Which diagnosis pointed at it:**

### Attack Run — After

<!-- Same format. `run_attacks.py --label after` -->



**Did it help, and how do I know:**

<!-- Widening the unsure band usually fixes one problem and creates another.
     Reporting that trade honestly is worth full credit. -->



---

## What's Still Broken

<!-- For each attack still getting through and each criterion still missed:
     what you'd do, and why you stopped. -->



**The trade I'd make if this ran for real:**

<!-- Two sentences. Fewer wrong accusations means more AI text getting through.
     Say which way you'd go and WHO PAYS FOR IT. -->
